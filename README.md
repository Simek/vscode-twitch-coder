5. Save your changes and close that tab. Go back to the Settings UI tab.
6. Find the `Nickname` setting. If you are using your own account for the chat bot then enter your account username as the value here. If you created a separate account use that username. Save your changes.
7. Make sure you're logged in to the Twitch account you wish to authorize the highlighter bot to access in your default browser.
8. In the status bar, click the "Twitch" button. After clicking it, you'll see a notification that the extension wants to open a URL.
9. Choose the "Open" option which should open a new tab of your default browser.

11. You should then be notified that you can close the browser/tab.
12. Go back to VS Code and you should now see "Disconnected" in the status bar. Click on it to Connect the bot to chat and start listening for highlight commands.

## üí¨ Twitch Commands
